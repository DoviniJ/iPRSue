\title{GWAS_QT function}
\usage{
GWAS_QT(discovery_pheno, discovery_geno_mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{discovery_pheno}{Character. Path to the phenotype file. This file should be tab- or space-delimited,
with no header, and the quantitative phenotype should be located in the third column.}

\item{discovery_geno_mat}{Character. Path to the genotype matrix file. This file should also be
delimited with no header, and each column corresponds to a SNP (e.g., encoded as 0, 1, 2).}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\describe{
\item{beta}{Estimated effect size from linear regression.}
\item{se}{Standard error of the effect size estimate.}
}
}
\description{
Performs univariate linear regression for each SNP to estimate effect sizes and standard errors
in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for a quantitative trait.
}
\details{
The function uses linear regression (\code{lm}) to regress the quantitative phenotype on each SNP separately.
The phenotype is standardized prior to analysis. No covariates are included in the model.
The genotype matrix and phenotype vector are assumed to be ordered consistently.

# Example usage:
# Phenotype file: 3rd column must contain a continuous outcome
# Genotype file: SNPs in columns, rows correspond to individuals
results <- GWAS_QT(discovery_pheno = "Qpd.txt", discovery_geno_mat = "Gd.txt")
head(results)
