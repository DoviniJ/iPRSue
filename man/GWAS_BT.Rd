\title{GWAS_BT function}
\usage{
GWAS_BT(discovery_pheno, discovery_geno_mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{discovery_pheno}{A character string specifying the path to the phenotype file. The file should have no header and contain individual IDs, and the third column should contain the binary trait (0/1).}

\item{discovery_geno_mat}{A character string specifying the path to the genotype matrix file. The file should have no header and contain numeric genotype data (e.g., 0, 1, 2) for each SNP.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\describe{
\item{beta}{Estimated effect size (log odds) for each SNP.}
\item{se}{Standard error of the estimated effect size.}
}
}
\description{
Performs genome-wide association analysis for a binary trait using logistic regression.
It reads a phenotype file and a genotype matrix, and estimates the SNP effect sizes and standard errors.
}
\details{
The function uses logistic regression (\code{glm} with \code{binomial(link="logit")}) to regress the binary phenotype on each SNP individually. The output includes only the regression coefficient and standard error for each SNP.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
  # Phenotype file: 3rd column must contain binary outcome (0/1)
  # Genotype file: SNPs in columns, rows correspond to individuals
  # Run GWAS on a binary trait with discovery phenotype and genotype files

  bpd <- system.file("Bpd.txt", package = "iPRSue", mustWork = TRUE)
  gd  <- system.file("Gd.txt",  package = "iPRSue", mustWork = TRUE)

  gwas_results <- GWAS_BT(
    discovery_pheno    = bpd,
    discovery_geno_mat = gd
  )
  head(gwas_results)
}
