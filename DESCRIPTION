Description: Provides tools for estimating uncertainty in individual 
    polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using both sampling-based and analytical 
    methods, as well as the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE). 
    These methods quantify variability in PRS estimates for both binary 
    and quantitative traits.
